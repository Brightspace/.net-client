Contributing
------------

We encourage pull-requests and other contributions from the community. We've also published an [SDK contributor's guide](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/v1.0/docs/sdk-contributors-guide) that provides a detailed explanation of how our SDKs work.

Unit Tests
----------

NUnit tests are in the `LaunchDarkly.Tests` project.  You may need to install the [NUnit Test adapter](http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&r=2.6) to be able to run them.
